possible engine changes:

using the projection matrix to move the camera position

using the depth buffer to avoid entity and particle z sorting

make use of the alpha blending and alpha test to allow transparent textures that work with the depth buffer

may have to enable clearing the depth buffer bit

having seprate layers (projection marticies) for the game world rendering and ui rendering

using the glscale function to avoid having to times everything by unit resolition

possibly being able to have a set camera and clear camera function that pushes and pops a new layer on the projection stack with the scale and position to stop having to recreate the ortho projection each time we switch to ui rendering
